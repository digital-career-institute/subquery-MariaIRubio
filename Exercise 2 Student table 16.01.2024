1. Create 3 tables	

	CREATE TABLE Student (StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY, StudentName VARCHAR(255));
	INSERT INTO Student VALUES 
	(1, 'Alice'), 
	(2, 'Bob'),
	(3, 'Charlie'),
	(4, 'David');

	CREATE TABLE Course (CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY, CourseName VARCHAR(255));
	INSERT INTO Course VALUES 
	(101, 'Math'),
	(102, 'English'),
	(103, 'Science'),
	(104, 'History');

	CREATE TABLE Enrollment (StudentID INT, CourseID INT, FOREIGN KEY(StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID), FOREIGN KEY(CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID));
	INSERT INTO Enrollment VALUES 
	(1, 101),
	(1, 102),
	(2, 101),
	(3, 102),
	(4, 103);

	SELECT * FROM Student;
	SELECT * FROM Course;
	SELECT * FROM Enrollment;


2. Write a query to retrieve the names of students who are enrolled in the 'Math' course.

	SELECT s.StudentName, e.CourseID 
	FROM Student s 
	JOIN Enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID  
	WHERE e.CourseID IN (SELECT CourseID FROM Course WHERE CourseName = 'Math');
	
3. Write a query to find the names of students who are not enrolled in any course.

	SELECT s.StudentName 
	FROM Student s 
	LEFT JOIN Enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID  
	WHERE e.CourseID IS NULL;
	
4. Write a query to retrieve the names of students who are enrolled in both 'Math' and 'English' courses.

	SELECT s.StudentName, e.CourseID 
	FROM Student s 
	JOIN Enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID  
	WHERE e.CourseID IN (SELECT CourseID FROM Course WHERE CourseName IN ('Math', 'English'));
	
5. Write a query to find the names of students who are not enrolled in any course using the NOT IN clause.

	SELECT s.StudentName
	FROM Student s
	WHERE StudentID NOT IN (SELECT StudentID FROM Enrollment);
	
6. Write a query to retrieve the names of students who are enrolled in at least one course using the EXISTS clause.

	SELECT StudentName
	FROM Student s
	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Enrollment e WHERE s.StudentID = e.StudentID);
	
7. Write a query to find the names of students who are not enrolled in any course using the NOT EXISTS clause.

	SELECT StudentName
	FROM Student s
	WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Enrollment e WHERE s.StudentID = e.StudentID);
